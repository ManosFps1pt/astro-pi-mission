                SPEED ESTIMATION OF ISS
    IERCSLG of 3rd GYMNASIUM OF IERAPETRA CRETE GREECE
    
To estimate the speed of ISS we use geographic coordinates to measure the distance in kms between two points (A, B) on the
surface of the earth, within time intervals of 1 second, i.e.
we take the position of ISS "now" and retake its position after 1 sec.
Then we devide the distance travelled by the time interval to calculate
the speed, in our case since time interval equals 1 sec, speed equals the travalled distance.

In order calculate the distance between any two points we use the Harvesine formula as explained in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaGj0DjX8W8.
We use time intervals of 1 second because according to our experiments it results to a better estimation, however
our program is general enough to allow any time interval by changing appropriately the value of "wait_time" variable.

We collect plenty such pair of points with each point pair resulting in a different speed estimation.
As the final speed estimation we take the median of the collected values.

In the mean time we collect various sensor values such as temprature, humidity, pressure, latitude, longitude etc.
which are saved in a .csv file, while intermediate results are kept in the output.txt file. The fianl result of speed
estimation is saved in the result.txt file.
